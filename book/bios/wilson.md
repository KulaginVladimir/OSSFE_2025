Paul Wilson is the Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering and current department chair of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/)â€˜s [Department of Nuclear Engineering & Engineering Physics](http://engineering.wisc.edu/neep). His research interests focus on developing improved tools for computational modeling of complex nuclear energy systems, with applications in radiation shielding, nuclear waste management, nuclear non-proliferation and energy policy. He has led the development of a number of software tools useful for fusion system analysis, including [ALARA](https://github.com/svalinn/ALARA), DAGMC, [PyNE](https://github.com/pyne/pyne), ParaStell, and [Cyclus](https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus).

He studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor Engineering (of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/)), earning his Dr.-Ing. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1998, and completed his Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering & Engineering Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999.
