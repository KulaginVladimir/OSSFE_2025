Estimating the costs of nuclear fusion power plants is essential for guiding research and development, optimizing designs, and accelerating commercialization through design-to-cost strategies. However, the absence of standardized methodologies for cost accounting and computation has limited the ability to compare devices and scenarios consistently. To address this, Woodruff Scientific LTD, with support from the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), is developing an open-source Python package that provides a standardized and flexible cost estimation framework for nuclear fusion power plants. This package, hosted on GitHub [1], features a modular architecture that allows for customization and integration into a wide array of applications, including web-based cost analysis platforms, automated cost documentation generation, and engineering design workflows. By enabling consistent cost modeling across diverse fusion device designs and performance scenarios, the framework facilitates comparative analyses and supports more informed decision-making within the fusion R&D community. We will present the packageâ€™s structure, its current capabilities, and pathways for future development, emphasizing its role in advancing cost-driven design methodologies for fusion commercialization.
