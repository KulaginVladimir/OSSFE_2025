Introducing the Struphy project: an open-development platform for plasma physics equations within the Python ecosystem. The first part of the talk is about project philosophy, purpose, current team, short- mid- and long-term goals. The second part shows some aspects of the actual code itself, such as the underlying data structures and particular design decisions. Moreover, the usage of Struphy via the API, the console, or as a model developer will be discussed. In the third part we present the currently available discretization schemes and discuss some results for MHD-kinetic hybrid models in Tokamak scenarios. We conclude by showing how to access, install and contribute to the code.
