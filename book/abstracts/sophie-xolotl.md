Xolotl is an open source DOE high-performance computing code using spatially dependent advection-reaction-diffusion kinetic rate theory to model the time evolution of defects and microstructure in irradiated materials. It has grown to model 5 different materials, be coupled to other simulation methods in a variety of ways, and integrate a grouping scheme and Kokkos for computational efficiency. The presentation will focus on introducing the fundamental principles and applications relevant to the fusion energy community.
