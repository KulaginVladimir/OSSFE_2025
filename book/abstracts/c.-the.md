The Open FUSION Toolkit[1] is an open-source suite of tools for fusion modeling with a focus on ease of use, tight integration with engineering workflows, and education. The present suite of physics tools include: 1) TokaMaker[2]: a 2D static and time-dependent Grad-Shafranov equilibrium tool designed as an user-friendly and open tool for design, control development and education, 2) ThinCurr[3]: a 3D thin-wall current modeling tool used to study currents in 3D device structures (eg. ports) and as an alternative to fourier-based current potential formulations in stellarator coil optimization, 3) MUG[4]: a 3D linear/nonlinear time-dependent MHD tool for plasma dynamics in arbitrary domains, and 4) Marklin[5]: a 3D force-free, uniform  ideal MHD equilibrium solver. A common core provides capabilities to all tools, including: meshing from CAD models, scalable linear and nonlinear solvers, extensible finite element representations, parallelization via OpenMP+MPI, and 3D visualization. Core functionality is implemented in C/C++/Fortran with Python interfaces for interactive applications and scripting. This talk will present a summary of the toolkit (highlighting applications in each domain) and describe methods to support community adoption including: binary packaging, documentation, and code design.
