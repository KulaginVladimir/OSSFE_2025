The Fusion Energy Neutronics Workshop is an openly available resource designed to facilitate neutronics analysis in fusion energy research through a comprehensive suite of simulation examples and a user-friendly compute environment.
Utilizing Jupyter Notebook/Lab format, our workshop offers detailed, instructional examples that cover a wide range of neutronics simulations essential for fusion reactor analysis. Topics include cross-section plotting, material creation, geometric modeling, neutron and photon source terms, tritium breeding simulations, displacing damage assessment (DPA) simulations, neutron spectra analysis, fast flux evaluation, instantaneous dose calculations, depletion studies, shutdown dose rate simulations, detector simulations, and stochastic volume calculations, as well as variance reduction techniques and CAD geometry conversion.
To enhance accessibility, the workshop is packaged as a Docker container that can be run locally or on cloud platforms such as GitHub Codespaces. We provide thorough installation tutorials for Linux, Windows, and Mac, along with an expanding collection of instructional videos covering various tasks.
Emphasizing reproducibility and accessibility, the workshop utilizes an entirely open-source software stack, incorporating specific neutronics tools such as OpenMC, DAGMC, Paramak, cad-to-dagmc, and neutronics-material-maker.
Hosted on GitHub and available under a permissive use license (MIT), our workshop adheres to standard software practices, including continuous integration testing that ensures the reliability of each task.
Since its inception in 2019, the workshop has evolved into a valuable educational resource for degree courses and training material for analysts. It has greatly benefited from community contributions, refining tasks to enhance their relevance and usability in the field.
