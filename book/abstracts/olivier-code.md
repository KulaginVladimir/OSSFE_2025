This talk will present a history of the last 30-40 years of international collaborations related to codes for fusion plasmas (tokamaks and stellarators) and the implications of an open-source like agreement developed some thirty years ago. The Swiss Plasma Center is dedicated to provide excellent numerical codes to the fusion community and moves towards full open-source licenses and towards collaborations with non-academic entities. Challenges and key decision points, not quite backward compatible, will be discussed.
