Physics-based simulations are essential to improve understanding of plasma behavior in nuclear fusion reactors.  Due to their high computational cost, it is necessary to make this data broadly available to the general fusion community. In this talk, we describe MGKDB, an open-source MongoDB for nuclear fusion simulations. It aims to provide a unified platform for researchers in the nuclear fusion community to share and access data for analysis. MGKDB stores a subset of input files required to reproduce the run, the gyrokinetics IMAS, and some metadata describing the run. Currently supported code bases include GENE, CGYRO, TGLF and GS2.
