The mission of the PlasmaPy project is to grow a fully open source Python ecosystem for plasma research and education. The PlasmaPy package is being developed to include core functionality needed by plasma scientists across divisions. PlasmaPy is a platform for the plasma community to collaborate and openly share commonly needed software functionality that was directly inspired by the successes of Astropy and SunPy. After covering the history and current status of PlasmaPy, I will discuss our efforts to grow the PlasmaPy community and promote open plasma science. I will conclude with several challenges faced by PlasmaPy related to community building, growing a workforce of research software engineers, and improving the plasma science data environment.
