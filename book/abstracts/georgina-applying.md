Bluemira is an open-source Python 3 framework for designing fusion power plants. It makes use of interdisciplinary models and incorporates a range of design activities, each of which is parameterised and automated. The Bluemira framework enables users to swiftly produce and investigate concept designs, making it a valuable tool for power plant component integration and whole-plant modelling.

One of the key aspects of designing a tokamak is maintaining a plasma equilibrium solution while optimising for poloidal field coils and divertor configurations. For example, a user might want to preserve an input equilibrium plasma shape and constrain the forces experienced by the coilsÂ whilst minimising the heat flux directed at the divertor targets.

We demonstrate the implementation of newly available Bluemira equilibria optimisation problems and constraints, and we investigate their effects for a device concept based on Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) specifications. In particular, we present the results of poloidal field coil and, first wall and divertor designers when optimising using divertor field shaping parameters such as flux expansion and connection length. Finally, we highlight how the resulting Bluemira outputs could be used when considering whole plant design.
