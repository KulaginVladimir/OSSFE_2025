The FuseNet Association was founded to be a platform for the coordination of European fusion education in 2010. Rooted in academia, we are driven by the notion that the students of now will be the researchers, engineers and pioneers of the future. By connecting and facilitating educators and students across Europe, we build on this understanding. We want to make fusion the place to be for bright and motivated people. By connecting academia with industry and supporting student mobility we stimulate fusion students to get in touch with the work field. By granting free access to learning resources we are trying spread the word about fusion to an as large audience as possible.
