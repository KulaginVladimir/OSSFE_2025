How to use XMARTe, a graphical interface which abstracts the complexities of developing configuration files for the configuration of real time applications in MARTe2. MARTe2 is a real time configuration based application framework commissioned and developed from ITER which is intended for plasma control however provides flexibility to work in any acquisition or control application. By providing a graphical representation of how an application is configured and method to define these, it reduces the barrier of entry for users and provides a intuitive approach to giving a visual appreciation of the block based design to MARTe2 applications.
