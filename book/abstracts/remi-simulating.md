WarpX is an open-source, high-performance Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code that offers a comprehensive set of features and supports a growing user community. Originally developed under the U.S. Department of Energy Exascale Computing Project to simulate plasma-based particle accelerators, WarpX has since been applied to a wide range of plasma physics challenges in various fusion concepts, including inertial fusion, laser-plasma interactions, Field-Reverse Configurations and magnetic mirrors.

Its open-source nature has been a key factor in its adoption by researchers from both academic institutions and private companies, several of whom have also contributed improvements back to the codebase. This talk will provide an overview of WarpX's capabilities relevant to fusion applications and highlight the key factors that have driven its successful community growth.
