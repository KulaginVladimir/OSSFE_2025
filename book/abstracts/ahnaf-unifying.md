The open-source nuclear landscape holds immense potential for innovation. However, the fragmentation of tools, systems, and installation methods often hampers researchers, educators, and students from unlocking its full potential. NukeHub was created to transform this fragmented landscape.

Our mission is to simplify access to nuclear open-source tools by creating a unified ecosystem. By tackling challenges in software integration and fostering collaboration, we enable users to focus on innovation rather than troubleshooting. Whether in fission, fusion, or materials science, our goal is to build a space where researchers, educators, and students can contribute, learn, and innovate together.

In this session, weâ€™ll demonstrate how NukeHub is addressing the challenges of fragmented nuclear open-source tools, share our plans for streamlining software integration, and showcase our efforts in building a collaborative open-source community. Attendees will also participate in a hands-on tutorial to learn how to get started with some of the tools we support.
