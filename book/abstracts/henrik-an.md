The Orbit Weight Computational Framework (OWCF) provides users in the plasma physics community with the possibility to effectively and efficiently compute phase-space sensitivities. In addition, a plethora of tools enable the user to transform between different coordinates, load and save data from other codes, interactively analyze results and work with fast-ion distributions etc. In the latest version, the OWCF has been updated to allow users to reconstruct fast-ion distributions F by solving an inverse problem of the form S=WF, where S is a set of diagnostic measurements and W is a matrix containing the diagnostic sensitivities in phase space. This work describes this new reconstruction tool, together with many new additions and updates since the initial publication.
