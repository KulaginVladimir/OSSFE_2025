OpenMC is an open-source Monte Carlo neutral particle transport code designed to perform high-fidelity simulations of neutron transport and other particle interactions. OpenMC supports a wide range of applications, from reactor physics and fusion neutronics to advanced research in computational physics. Its Python API attached to C++ particle transport kernels facilitate user-friendly model building and seamless integration with other computational frameworks, enabling researchers to develop customized workflows and perform complex multi-physics simulations.

Key features of OpenMC include its support for various nuclear data formats, solution modes, andÂ performance on modern HPC architectures. Recent advancements have focused on GPU portability and efficiency, variance reduction techniques, and expanded support for geometry formats. OpenMC also provides robust tools for geometric modeling and tallying, making it an invaluable resource for both academic and industrial research.

OpenMC plays a crucial role in multiphysics simulations by coupling with thermal-hydraulics, structural mechanics, and fuel performance codes to model reactor behavior more accurately. The interoperability provided by the C++ API enables comprehensive analysis of nuclear systems, enhancing a broad range predictive capabilities. By facilitating these complex integrations, OpenMC serves as a key component in neutronics modeling in several multiphysics frameworks.

The OpenMC project thrives on contributions from a global community of developers and users. Through collaborative efforts, the codebase continues to evolve to address emerging challenges in nuclear engineering and computational science.
