This study presents methodological advancements for openMC modeling of magnetic, inertial and magneto-inertial fusion energy systems.  Significant advancements include the implementation of advanced source profile modelling, which enables precise spatial and strength-weighted mapping of neutron sources along magnetic field axes or pressure profiles, ensuring detailed and realistic simulations. Additionally, the integration of the CadToDagMC package automates the conversion of CAD .step files into DAGMC-compatible .h5m meshes, streamlining simulation workflows and reducing pre-processing complexity. The framework also supports Multiphysics interactions by coupling neutronics with thermal and mechanical simulations, enhancing its capability to evaluate performance comprehensively. Furthermore, batch processing and parameter sweep capabilities facilitate the efficient exploration of large design spaces and rapid optimization of reactor configurations. The framework has been used to generate high-fidelity data for key metrics such as tritium breeding ratio (TBR), neutronic heating, neutron flux distributions, and displacement per atom (DPA) across various configurations. The results show that these methodological innovations significantly improve scalability, providing valuable tools for designers, material scientists, and the broader fusion community, ultimately accelerating the development of cost-effective and commercially viable fusion energy systems.
