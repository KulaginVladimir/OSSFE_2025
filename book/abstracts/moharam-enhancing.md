The general idea of the research is to find another method of operation for the Tokamak device to increase the number of the probable combinations between the positive ions of the deuterium and tritium responsible for the fusion process using the electromagnetic field effects.

The new design of the device depends mainly on the Electric field produced by high voltage capacitors distributed alongside the Tokamak device tube. The capacitors should be separate, each of which has a different voltage source to generate a controllable Electric field perpendicular on the magnetic field that penetrates the Tokamak tube.Therefore, this electromagnetic field can control the direction of the positive ions responsible for the fusion and increase the number of probable collisions amongst them.

The research mainly aims at increasing the efficiency of the Tokamak device and finding a better way of Plasma confinement.
