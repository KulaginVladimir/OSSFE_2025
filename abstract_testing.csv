The tool is primarily focused on inertial fusion, but also has capabilities which are useful for magnetic fusion. NeSST implements literature models for the primary neutron-producing fusion reactions in DT plasmas (DT, DD and TT). It also uses evaluated nuclear data files to calculate scattered spectra, under the single scatter approximation. This is essential in inertial fusion to model the downscatter of neutrons in the target. Scattering is computed using relativistic corrections and the effects of finite temperature and velocity of the scattering medium. Finally, NeSST includes standard diagnostic models for time-of-flight neutron spectral analysis. The code has been used to model experimental data from the OMEGA facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics. NeSST makes use of a few other open-source fusion energy projects: python-ENDF[2] and pydress[3].

The new design of the device depends mainly on the Electric field produced by high voltage capacitors distributed alongside the Tokamak device tube. The capacitors should be separate, each of which has a different voltage source to generate a controllable Electric field perpendicular on the magnetic field that penetrates the Tokamak tube.Therefore, this electromagnetic field can control the direction of the positive ions responsible for the fusion and increase the number of probable collisions amongst them.

The research mainly aims at increasing the efficiency of the Tokamak device and finding a better way of Plasma confinement.","Moharam Mohamed, Nuclear and Radiation Engineering /Alexandria University ;

However, accurately modelling these phenomena is computationally prohibitive, necessitating the development of efficient surrogate models.

This work focuses on creating surrogate models from 3D particle-in-cell simulations using the EPOCH framework. These models incorporate quantum electrodynamic (QED) processes, radiation reaction effects, and relativistic transparency to predict electron energy distributions and refine the equation of motion under extreme conditions. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) serves as the foundation for these models, enabling predictions with uncertainty quantification.

Supporting this effort is the open-source Broad EPOCH Analysis Modules (BEAM) toolkit, which integrates tools like sdf-xarray for SDF file processing, epydeck for simulation input management, and epyscan for parameter space sampling. These tools streamline large-scale simulations, ensuring reproducibility and extensibility for the community.

Neutronics workflows require watertight geometry to avoid particle leakage. Iterative studies become impractical if dependant on overly manual geometry preparation. To address these and similar challenges we introduce Hypnos, a parametric geometry engine focused on breeder blanket design. It aims to ease the process of geometry creation and mesh generation. It uses Coreform Cubit for CAD generation and meshing, due to its reliability, automatic meshing capabilities, and support for a wide range of export formats. As far as possible, this has been decoupled from the code to allow for switching out of the backend. Geometrical parameters are specified in json files, which are provided as inputs. Hypnos has two modes of operation. The first is as a standalone python script run from the terminal. This simply generates and exports the described geometry or mesh file. The second is as a python library. This allows for bespoke workflows, for example a parametric design optimisation. Currently Hypnos contains a parametrised breeder blanket model based off of a DEMO HCPB blanket pre-conceptual design. However, it has been developed to allow users to create their own models. Geometry creation aims to be modular and extensible to facilitate re-usability. Hypnos automatically tracks blocks, sidesets, and materials of components (with the latter for use with DAGMC for neutronics calculations).","Siddharth Mungale, Helen Brooks, Luke Humphrey; UKAEA",Hypnos is an open-source software that is a part of a toolchain for breeder blanket related optimisation work. ,https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/hypnos,Yes,,Rémi Delaporte-Mathurin,1,1,1,0,0.5,"1,50","2,5",oral,C2,S_C

Previous versions, TMAP4 and TMAP7, facilitated one-dimensional thermal and mass-diffusive transport and trapping calculations. However, their capabilities were limited. For example, both could only model one dimensional domains and were limited in the number of trapping site populations (1 for TMAP4, and 3 for TMAP7). Moreover, they did not easily lend themselves to multiphysics simulations, which limited the accuracy of their predictions. To alleviate these constraints, TMAP8, built on the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework, offers high-fidelity modeling and simulation of tritium transport, enhancing previous capabilities and enabling more efficient design and safety analysis of fusion pilot plants.
TMAP4 and TMAP7 capabilities were thoroughly tested in verification and validation (V&V) cases. Following standard engineering terminology, “Verification” is the process of determining that a computational model accurately represents the underlying mathematical model and its solution. “Validation” is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model – requiring comparison against experimental data. TMAP8 has been tested on the same suite of V&V cases to build trust and demonstrate its accuracy in modeling hydrogen isotope transport. These cases are an integral part of the high software quality standards set for TMAP8, which is Nuclear Quality Assurance, Level 1 (NQA-1) compliant. 
Moreover, TMAP8 is open-source, is thoroughly documented, and uses a flexible license that enables effective collaborations, including public-private partnerships. The TMAP8 online documentation describes all its capabilities, all V&V cases with the associated results and input files, and clear instructions on how to get started. The documentation also includes example and demonstration cases beyond what TMAP4 and TMAP7 were capable of doing, including simulating a complete tritium fuel cycle, two- and three-dimensional tritium migration and heat transfer within a divertor monoblock, pore scale simulations in breeder materials, and others. These cases showcase TMAP8’s ability to retain TMAP4 and TMAP7 essential features while significantly expanding capabilities for complex multiphysics and multiscale analyses on high performance computers. Despite these state-of-the-art capabilities, we will also show that TMAP8 is easy to use and is suitable for different expertise levels.","Pierre-Clément A. Simon, Idaho National Laboratory; Casey T.

High-fidelity multiphysics computational tools are essential to understand, model, and quantify the complex interactions between plasma, neutron exposure, materials performance, and engineering processes. This is evident when considering plasma facing components, which are under extreme thermal loads (~1-20 MW/m2), endure repeated thermal shocks, and are irradiated by plasma ions, photons, and high-energy neutrons throughout their lifecycle. Before deployment of a fusion energy system, the design of plasma-facing components with acceptable lifetime degradation is highly challenging.
The Fusion ENergy Integrated multiphys-X (FENIX) framework meets these needs by leveraging the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework, partly-developed by international collaborators, the United States Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program, and several INL’s Laboratory Directed Research-funded programs. FENIX integrates various existing MOOSE capabilities, such as the heat conduction, solid mechanics and thermal hydraulics modules, with MOOSE-based applications including Cardinal (neutronics and computational fluid dynamics) and TMAP8 (Tritium Migration Analysis Program, version 8). Moreover, FENIX contains dedicated capabilities for plasma edge modeling, which will support multiphysics plasma-material interaction simulations. This comprehensive and modular integration built on the MOOSE framework allows FENIX to perform massively parallel multiphysics simulations, which are essential for the design, safety analysis, and performance evaluation of fusion systems. FENIX aims to model the harsh environment in which these components operate, thus accelerating their design and evaluation processes. Moreover, FENIX is developed in an open-source manner, with a continuous integration system to facilitate rigorous testing and high software quality assurance (SQA) standards. The framework's modularity, open and collaborative development, extensive documentation, and adherence to high SQA standards fosters rapid training, workforce development in universities, and effective collaborations - including public-private partnerships with national laboratories. These capabilities have been demonstrated on plasma facing components such as the ITER divertor monoblocks needed for removal of plasma impurities and high heat loads.
This presentation will cover the current capabilities of FENIX and showcase preliminary results modeling plasma facing components. We will also discuss how FENIX and other MOOSE-based applications are being utilized in the fusion community to address critical scientific and engineering challenges, ultimately supporting the deployment of fusion energy as a sustainable power source.

At the time, JADE was focused on bringing automation and standardization to the Verification and Validation (V&V) procedures of nuclear data libraries. From the very beginning, the ambitious objective was to build an expandable open-source framework that could centralize the efforts of a community, the one of nuclear data libraries evaluators, that was characterized by limited and fragmented manpower. Since then, the tool was applied with success in helping the V&V procedures of many new nuclear data libraries releases, with a special focus on FENDL, by which JADE was officially endorsed. In the last couple of years, the tool development has been pushed forward by Fusion For Energy and UKAEA with a new objective: use the JADE framework also to perform code to code comparisons. This new collaboration led to JADE v3, a first proof of concept that ported the tool on the linux platform and allowed for the first time to run benchmarks not only with MCNP but also with OpenMC. During this phase, the JADE environment was restructured and components with different scopes were made independent and separated in different repositories. Despite all these achievements, it became clearer that adding new features to JADE was becoming increasingly harder because JADE was not initially conceived with this broader scope in mind. The code base reached a high degree of complexity and was becoming a barrier for the onboarding of new developers in the project. These reasons led to the work presented here, which focus on the latest iteration of JADE development: JADE v4. The entire core architecture has been refactored following two main principles. The first is that JADE is conceived now from the very beginning to be a framework for comparison of code-library results and not simply for library to library or for code to code. The second is that the csv data produced by JADE, which are essentially the results of the different simulations in a table format, will be now a key interface. That is, all post-processing that is transport code dependent will end with the production of the csv. This allows the JADE post-processing (plots and excel summaries) to be completely transport code independent. A side benefit of this is that a better interface is created for the JADE web app. Moreover, this will allow to expand the JADE benchmark suite only through configuration files and input templates, without the need for additional coding. Finally, the extensive refactoring also allowed to implement a series of software design best practices which significantly increased JADE robustness and expandability.","Davide Laghi, Fusion For Energy; Alberto Bittesnich, Fusion For Energy; Alex Valentine, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority; Steve C.

We assess projects by performing software ""health checks"", making recommendations to the authors, and helping implement the most impactful changes. Our work often includes adding testing and documentation, setting up continuous integration and automation, and packaging projects for smooth and easy distribution.

Many of our projects are helping researchers transition from single-use codes, often written during their PhDs, to more general purpose research software. For example, Scotty[2], a beam tracer for tokamak back-scatter doppler diagnostics, was initially written as a collection of Python scripts for a PhD project at the University of York and UKAEA. With the help of our support, it is now a much more robust research software package, used by multiple groups around the world.

We provide longer-term support for some projects, such as Pyrokinetics[3], a common interface for gyrokinetic codes which enables easier cross-code comparisons. We have been involved since the beginning, helping to ensure that the package is able to meet researchers' needs while staying maintainable and sustainable. Pyrokinetics is now a widely used community tool.

We're also continually involved in the wider open-source community, contributing bugfixes, performance improvements, and new features to projects such as netCDF, FAIRDataPipeline[4], and fortranformat[5]. Our latest community tool is fortitude[6], a very fast Fortran linter.

20,6/1/2025 17:08,Vladimir Kulagin,VVKulagin@mephi.ru,Yes,Oral presentation,Tritium transport and Fuel Cycle,"Modelling of deuterium release from tungsten co-deposited films induced
by laser heating","Co-deposition of hydrogen isotopes and materials of plasma-facing components is one of the dominant fuel retention mechanisms in fusion devices [1]. The control for hydrogen isotope inventory in co-deposited layers is crucial for the sustainable operations of a device. Laser-induced desorption (LID) is a proposed technique for in situ monitoring of hydrogen content [2], which involves laser heating of a surface, followed by measurements of the released hydrogen isotopes.

In the present work, the open-source finite-element code FESTIM [3] is used to model experiments on LID of deuterium (D) from 1 μm-thick tungsten (W) films, co-deposited on a copper substrate (thickness of 3 mm). The simulation workflow included two major steps. First, the D trap properties in W films were obtained by fitting spectra from thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements [4]. Then, 2D multi-material LID simulations were conducted assuming axial symmetry. Spatiotemporal distribution of the beam power density was set according to the experimental fiber laser system (IPG, 0.1-10 ms, 1070 nm).

Considering the ratio of domain length scales, the 2D LID problem required high mesh refinement within the W region. To simplify the modelling, we conducted a series of 1D deuterium transport simulations along the radial profile of the laser beam using a discretised temperature profile from 2D simulations. For the studied problem, such an approach is shown to agree reasonably with full 2D simulations, but be more computationally efficient. It allowed to reconstruct distributions of the retention field and compare the simulation results with experimental LID data.

It encompasses the preparation of exceptionally large and detailed computer models that could not possibly handled by hand and need a high degree of automatization to be dealt with. To give an order of magnitude of the problem, E-lite, which is an MCNP detailed model of the entire ITER tokamak, is composed by more than 400 thousands cells and output files produced by simulations performed on these models can easily occupy more than a few Gb of storage.

To address these kinds of challenges, a great number of scripts was produced during the years at Fusion For Energy (F4E) that presented a wide range of maturity, verification level and documentation quality. The neutronics team of F4E recently decided to collect all these codes, refactor them, generalize them, and aggregate them into a unique pip installable python package named F4Enix distributed under the EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2 terms. The primary objectives of F4Enix are:
•	Automate and streamline the pre and post-processing operations involved in nuclear response computations for ITER or similar projects.
•	Significantly enhance the efficiency, capability, and overall quality of the entire nuclear analysis workflow.
•	Allow to maintain, test, and document all code related to nuclear analyses workflows in a single place.
•	Build synergies between the different code parts.
•	Provide a useful tool to F4E suppliers.

F4Enix also provides a comprehensive and up-to-date documentation that describes the installation, usage, and API of the package. The documentation is hosted online using Read the Docs, a service that builds and serves the documentation whenever the code is updated. Finally, F4Enix is automatically built and uploaded to the PyPi index every time a new version is tagged, making it available through a simple pip install.

24,8/1/2025 4:27,Vladimir Kulagin,VVKulagin@mephi.ru,Yes,Oral presentation,Software validation and verification,Kinetic surface model in FESTIM: Verification and Validation,"Accumulation and transport of hydrogen (H) in materials are topical subjects of study in various research fields (nuclear fusion, hydrogen storage and transport, material science, etc.). Numerical modelling of H dynamics plays an important role in these fields allowing to perform prognostic estimations, validate theoretical models and construct new predictive ones. FESTIM (Finite Element Simulation of Tritium In Materials) [1] is a flexible open-source code developed for simulating the H transport in materials. For years, it has been successfully applied to study the H transport for fusion-related applications.

Before the v1.3 release, the physics basis of FESTIM covered a wide range of bulk and surface processes, implemented dependent on the concentration of solute H. For the latter ones, this is a simplification valid when surface processes are fast compared to bulk ones, so the concentrations of adsorbed and absorbed H are in equilibrium. However, there are conditions when the evolution of the adsorbed H concentration should be taken into account [2]. A representative example is the H retention in a material exposed to a low-energy atomic/molecular flux. When the energy of incident particles is not high enough to overcome the surface barrier for implantation, incoming particles can stick to a surface and only then be absorbed into the bulk.

In the recent release of FESTIM, a kinetic surface model was introduced, allowing users to consider the temporal evolution of the H surface concentration in H transport simulations. To ensure the correctness of the model and provide the reliability to the users, the model underwent extensive verification and validation. In this work, the correctness of the implementation is first proven using the method of manufactured solutions. Then, reliability of the model is demonstrated by reproducing four experimental cases on the dynamics of hydrogen isotope retention in different materials. An additional cross-code comparison with two other simulation packages, TESSIM-X [2] and MHIMS [3], shows an excellent agreement and strengthens the validity of the model.
